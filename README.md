## This is just a plain fork from [JimmyCushnie](https://github.com/JimmyCushnie)'s [Noisy-Nodes](https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/Noisy-Nodes) (based on [keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro)'s [Noise Shader](https://github.com/keijiro/NoiseShader)) to make sure this stays online....


# Noisy Nodes

All of the fancy parts of this library come from [Noise Shader](https://github.com/keijiro/NoiseShader) by  keijiro. I just made shader graph nodes to call the functions.

## Installation

Download the whole repo and stick it in your project's `Assets` folder.

Alternatively, Noisy Nodes can be installed via the Unity Package Manager. In the top left of the `Packages` window, navigate to `Add Package -> Add package from git URL` and paste `https://github.com/HebelHuber/Noisy-Nodes.git`.
